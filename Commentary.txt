Roman Numerals Kata

Roman to Arabic
---------------


1. Use FluentAssrtions test with set of simpler 'additive' Roma Numerals data.

That works. Good, now we've something to work with.

2. Append the method so it can handle 'subtractive'numerals.

3. Test with the previous 'additive' data.

4. That works, now test with a set of 'subtractive' numerals.

Bingo!


Now for the reverse method - Arabic integers to Roman Numerals ...


Arabic to Roman
---------------

1. Write some pseudo-code for the algorithm design and implement it.

2. Test just one simple case to ensure the method accepts and returns something valid.

3. Execute multiple test cases, especially ensuring all subtractive operations are covered.
That'll be the 900s, 400s, 90s, 40s, 9s, 4s.

Grand - it works.

4. Decide your algorithm is ungainly. Rewrite

This now needs making into an iterative loop, with a couple of fixed arrays - 
of Roman Numeral strings, and decimal ints to use as a look up to build the converted output string/int:.

However, I've spent enough time on it!
